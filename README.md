This is an initial attempt to separate RDF from Titanium JSON-LD. The primitives have not been fully separated yet (https://github.com/filip26/titanium-json-ld/issues/396), but the rest is in place.

* [Titanium JSON-LD](https://github.com/filip26/titanium-json-ld)
* [Titanium RDF N-QUADS](https://github.com/filip26/titanium-rdf-n-quads)
* [Titanium RDF Dataset Canonicalization](https://github.com/filip26/titanium-rdf-canon)
* [Titanium RDF API](https://github.com/filip26/titanium-rdf-api)

This repository should be deprecated and eventually deleted in favor of the separate artifacts.

@larsw Thank you for starring this repo! I hope you find the separated repositories more convenient. Please feel free to open an issue, ask questions, or contribute!
